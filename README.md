# Welcome to my Notes/Zettelkasten

This is my personal knowledge base. The idea is to create a minimalist version
of the of the [Zettelkasten] and bring it into the 21st century in digital form.

All notes are created with the [zet] script from rwxrob. At some point I will
create my own version of it and delete all functions I don't need and add my own.

* The folders are created with a unique ID, which is just the current UTC second 
created with `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S`.
