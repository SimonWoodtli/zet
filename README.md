This is my personal knowledge base. The idea is to create a minimalist version
of the of the [Zettelkasten] and bring it into the 21st century in digital

These Zettels (notes) have been created with my [zet] command line utility.

> 📝 Folders are created with `date -u +%Y%m%d%H%M%S` to create a unique ID.
Which is just a current time stamp in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
