# Dotfile Manager: chezmoi

For a cloud-native OS approach having a separate CLI workspace alone is not enough. The dotfiles also need to be able to get rewritten and updated when the workspace image gets rebuild.

## Advantages

Currently I use a second local repo that has more sensitive information or configuration in it. Using `chezmoi` means no longer having to separate the two. Also having to manage `setup` scripts to symlink configurations for different programs becomes a thing of the past.

* Password manager support
* Full file encryption with `gpg` or `age`: Encrypts secret files so you can keep them in your dotfiles repo. 
* Manage your dotfiles across multiple diverse machines, securely. Put Configurations in different Folders for different operating systems (Linux|Mac|Windows).
* Templates allow for custom profiles for machines that don't need all configuration or different versions of the same configuration file.
* Go binary, no scripting language dependency for running it
* Creates actual files and copies them to right location (symlinking is not the best approach)
* Still utilizes the git repo approach

## Installation

* Mindows: `choco install chezmoi`
* Mac: `nix-env -i chezmoi`
* Linux: 
    * Nix: `nix profile install nixpkgs#chezmoi` 
    * Alpine: `apk add chezmoi`
    * Termux: `pkg install chezmoi`

Any other distro: `sh -c "$(curl -fsLS get.chezmoi.io)"`   
The shell script install created a /bin folder in `pwd` and put chezmoi in there. I just moved it to ~/.local/bin

## First Setup

What chezmoi does: It looks at what kind of file and where the file is stored and both information are being used when it copies the file into .local/share/chezmoi. e.g a dot file gets named `dot_bashrc`. It will recreate the folder structure, so `feh` which stores config files in ~/.config/feh config is named `dot_config/feh/keys`.

> üßê initializing creates a new local git repo in `/home/username/.local/share/chezmoi` with the remote that points to your github dotfiles.git

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If your current dotfile system has a setup script to symlink all the dotfiles repo files to the right place don't use `chezmoi add ~/.bashrc`. This would just add the symlink to `chezmoi`. Instead use `chezmoi add --follow ~/.bashrc`


1. install chezmoi
1. create new empty dotfiles repo on github: `gcr` (I don't want all the bloat
   that accumulated over time in my dotfiles-old)
1. initialize chezmoi at specific location with custom dirname and ssh (prefer): `chezmoi -S
   /home/xnasero/Repos/github.com/SimonWoodtli/dotfiles/home init
   git@github.com:SimonWoodtli/dotfiles.git`
      1. initialize chezmoi at default (~/.local/share) with ssh: `chezmoi init git@github.com:SimonWoodtli/dotfiles.git`
      1. initialize chezmoi with https: `chezmoi init https://github.com/SimonWoodtli/dotfiles.git`

1. configure chezmoi: ??
1. adding symlinks: `chezmoi add -f ~/.bashrc`
   Otherwise you would need `rm ~/.bashrc && cp ?/dotfiles-old/bashrc ~/.bashrc
   && cd && chezmoi add .bashrc` (if you migrate from old symlink system)
1. adding files to be managed as templates: `chezmoi add --autotemplate ~/.gitconfig`

`chezmoi add  -T --autotemplate ~/.gitconfig`

`chezmoi add --encrypt  foo`
`chezmoi add --template foo`
File in sourceDir, change regular file into template: `chezmoi chattr +template foo` (easier for me: `mv foo foo.tmpl`)


## Setup any New Machine

1. install chezmoi
1. git clone my dotfiles into ~/Repos/github.com/SimonWoodtli
1. `chezmoi -S ~/Repos/github.com/SimonWoodtli/dotfiles init --apply`

## Test output of any given template:

* `chezmoi execute-template --init --promptString email=xnasero@posteo.net < $(chezmoi source-path)/.chezmoi.yaml.tmpl`
* `chezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.sourceDir }}'`

## Remove files:

* use `chezmoi unmanage` to remove the target from the source, but leave it in the destination. A simple `rm foo sourcedir/foo` would be the same
* use `chezmoi remove` (or its alias chezmoi rm) to remove the target from both.

### Boolean Functions

| Function | Go Template Lang       | JavaScript |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
|not       |Inverts its argument    |!           |
|and       |A boolean and           |&&          |

### Nested example

{{ if (and (eq .chezmoi.os "darwin") (eq .chezmoi.version.builtBy "HomeBrew")) }}
You're one of the smart Mac users, you use homebrew üôÇ
