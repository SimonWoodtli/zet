# Backups vs. Archive

All backup media have a finite lifetime before becoming unreadable. The
conventional estimates are listed below:

Magnetic Tapes: 10-30 years
CDs and DVDs: 3-10 years
Hard Disks: 2-5 years

Lifetime is very sensitive to:

Environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, etc.)
Quality of media
Having working software that can read data on current operating systems and hardware

## The issue

Lifetime is sufficient for backup, but not for permanent digital archiving.

For lifetimes longer than the usual backup timescales, data can be preserved
using multiple copies, plus copying over to newer media from time to time.

For very long times (i.e., many decades, centuries, etc.), standard methods do
not work easily, as everything can go obsolete: hardware, software and document
format, media.

None of the inexpensive digital formats can actually compete with paper and
film for long periods of time (if they are properly stored and continuously
cared for - like wine).
