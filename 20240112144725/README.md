# Why would you want to run your own DNS Server?

For privacy reasons and for convenience it may help to run your own DNS
server. One software that allows you to do so is bind9. There are different
ways to approach this:

1. On a custom router:
    1. With OpenWRT or pfSense you can do DNS host overwrites directly (this
       will give you local subdomains for your LAN server, but not more
       privacy). Some proprietary router firmwares also have this feature.
    1. With OpenWRT/pfSense you should also be able to use dnsmasq to achieve this.
    1. If you run other software on top of your router. You might want to add
       bind9 or another DNS server on it. This will give you privacy whilst
       using the internet at home or connected to it via VPN tunnel.
1. On a local LAN sever with bind9: Like mentioned before you get privacy and
   custom domains for your LAN as long as you are connected to your network.
1. On a VPS sever with bind9: Now you loose a little privacy and it might be a
   bit slower than a DNS on your LAN. But you can use it on any network
   conveniently.

## Privacy explained - Why should I care?

Your ISP may track your website visits, timestamps and metadata. If privacy is
your main concern. Then going with a public encrypted DNS is easier and more
effective (from my currently limited understanding of the topic).

## Convenience explained - Custom domain names why do I need that?

In short if you are running a local homelab and have some webapps and services
that have a web interface. You might want to access those sites more
conveniently. You probably don't want to deal with all those IPs and ports.

In long:

Running your own DNS server allows you to add any custom domain names and
subdomains that you want to assign to any of your homelab servers. In other
words your webapps/services can now be accessed with e.g https://sync.home
instead of http://192.168.0.5:8384.  However for this to work you also need a
proxy site since these services don‚Äôt run on port 80|443.

Why do we need both DNS and proxy? Because the domain name can only point to an
IP address. Since those webapps and services run on their own port we need a
proxy site too. That requires apache or nginx. At this point you can also
easily add certbot and pw authentication.

But not only homlab server would benefit from this also any remote server you
want to give a domain name would at least for you personally be reachable
without typing any pesky IPs or ports.

### What does not work

Some people recommend adding custom domain names that point to the IP of web
services to /etc/hosts of each of your machines. I tried this, but this method
is not working. Because you can only point the hostname of a given machine to
an alias hostname. But you cannot set any wildcards and hence no custom
subdomains can be used. The next best and simple solution seems to be dnsmasq.
So it would look like this:

```
192.168.0.5 hostnameOnMyPI aliasdomain
```

## My personal favorite methods

The question you should ask yourself do I want to expose those services to the
public internet or keep them on my LAN?

> üìù It's complicated and all methods have their ups and downs. A public custom DNS
has an easy DDOS attack vector and you also trust a cloud provider with your
data.

Don't run a custom DNS service like `bind9`. Instead use either:

1. If on LAN: Setup dnsmasq on your dietpi or router. It's easier than to learn bind9 and setting up a custom DNS.
      1. Close Seconds: Use encrypted DNS with stubby or DNS crypt.
      1. Research: is nginx proxy rly not able to deal with those subdomains
         without any of this hazzle if just for LAN usage?
1. If exposed public: Use tunneling methods like CloudFlare Tunnel or open
   source alternatives. Checkout this [repo] for some projects. They work no
   matter what your ISP situation, even if behind CGNAT and don't require port
   forwarding on your router.
