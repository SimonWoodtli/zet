# Devops Book List

Hope this helps, everyone feel free to correct me if i am wrong
--The Phoenix Project = Both in this community and on other devops places this a usual recomendation. The book takes a history and develop it around devops. Is a nice way to understand most devops concepts
--The Unicorn Project = Sequel to The Phoenix Project
--The DevOps Handbook = Similar to the previous two but the concepts are lay out in a more technical way i believe, not as a story
--The Linux Bible 10th or 9th edition = Recomended by @SullyInATX. 10th edition has a lot of new techs like cloud, ansible, terraform, things like that.
--The Linux Command Line
--UNIX and Linux System Administration
--Mastering Linux Shell Scripting: A practical guide to Linux command-line, Bash scripting, and Shell programming, 2nd Edition = The one that started all this chain, Sully gave to @eyawson
----Security focused books - Recomended as usual by out security specialist @SullyInATX----
