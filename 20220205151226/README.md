# Zettelkasten: Markdown Guideline

## General Rules

Generally speaking use the CommonMark guideline but extent it with these rules.

* Title max. 50 characters wide (so git commit message works too)
* Wrap everything but references block to 79 columns
* Substantial code, raw, and images should be in separate files
* All reference links must be explicit and visible
* Begin block quotes with a semantic emoji (> üßê)
* Try not too use too many embedded links but prefer to put them in 'Related'
  section at the end
* Only use screenshots when necessary, if you can describe something with words
  you should. Otherwise it will bloat your zet repo over time.
* No HTML allowed in any way
* No spaces between opening fence token and keyword
* Use three backticks for fenced content
* Only use three tildes if fenced content contains three backticks
* Only use four tildes if fenced content contains three tildes
* Use two or more trailing spaces for hard breaks
* Avoid horizontal rule like these: `----`
* Only `*`,`**`,`***` for italic, bold, bold italic
* Only `1.` for ordered lists
* Only `* ` for unordered lists
* Table block must begin with `|`
* If a block begins with `|` it *must* be a table.

## 1. Quote Blocks: Hints, Notes, Important etc.

### When

If you have some 'additional' info in a section/paragraph. Which relates to the
section/title/paragraph and can be described briefly.

### How

* Quoted blocks start with a angle bracket at the beginning
* Idea: `> üí°` 
* Note: `> üìù`
* Hint/Advice: `> üßê`
* Thought/Thinking: `> ü§î`
* Important/Warning: `> ‚ö†Ô∏è `
* Mistake: `> ü§¶`
* Search/Research: `> üîé`
* Book Related, Quotes/Info: `> üìö`

### Example

```markdown
> üßê Don‚Äôt forget to create Hints and Notes with a > at the beginning.
```

output:

> Hint: Don't forget to create Hints and Notes with a > at the beginning.

## 2. Embedded Links - Reference Links

### When?

* If it's an external link to another website mentioned inside a text block.
* If it's a search for a keyword on your githubs zet repo mentioned inside a 
text block.

> Hint: Never embed internal links

### How

If the link is embedded inside of text you can use `[Foo]`. And then put 
all the embedded links between in the Footer `Related:` and `Tags:`

* To get the github search of a keyword within vim: `!!zet query [searchterm]`

### Example

```markdown
# Title: Mini Example

This is an example of an embedded Link (reference) that is used to refer to a website or a search on your zets github repo.

* external link: If you want to know more about [basic Pandoc Markdown]
* github search: If you want to see all my [Zettelkasten] related zettels.

Tags:

```

## 3. Embedded Terms

### When

A term is a word that requires a definition. It is marked with tripple 
asterisk e.g. ***zettelkasten***. Terms can be added to a glossary or simply 
have additional information.

### How

* `***term***`

### Example

```markdown
And ***Zettelkasten*** can truly empower the way you organize knowledge.
```

output:

And ***Zettelkasten*** can truly empower the way you organize knowledge.

## 4. Tables

### When

I try not to use tables too often but sometimes they are great. Especially if
you can no longer easily describe content with a list.

### How

> üìù Use the table format that is supported by GitHub and (if and when added)
eventually CommonMark. 

* Only use `|` for table blocks

### Example

```markdown
|Name|Description|
-|-
Foo|The foo of it all
Bar|The bar as well
```

## 5. Footer: Related - Reference Links

### When

Links that are related to your current zettel:

* If it's an external link that you don't want to embed in your text.
* If it's an internal link that refers to another zettel inside your zet repo.

### How

* internal link of a zettel within vim: `!!zet link [searchterm]`
* external links: `* <https://duckduckgo.com>`

### Examples

```markdown
* [20220224055145](/20220224055145/) Zettelkasten `zet` commands: cheatsheet
* <https://duckduckgo.com>
```

output:

* [20220224055145](/20220224055145/) Zettelkasten `zet` commands: cheatsheet
* <https://duckduckgo.com>

# 6. Footer: Tags

### When

* Always add tags to your zettels as they make it easier to find them when your
  knowledge base grows.
* Also checkout the zettel about tags.

### How

* Use camelCase to create multi word tags, no whitespace
* Use hastag
* End of document at the very last line
* Indented with 4 spaces
* Tagline max. 79 characters 

> üìù Don't go overboard with too many tags keep it short and simple. Limiting
the tag length has the benefit of choosing tags more carefully and avoids
redundant tags or duplicants.

### Example

* Checkout the markdown example in '2. Embedded Links'
