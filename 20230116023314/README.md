# Difference between `su` and `su -`

> üßê If no username is given it will switch you to the root user, but you
probably need to prefix sudo to get permission.

Both `su` and `su -` can be used to switch users from the command line, but the
latter starts up a new login shell. So the difference is `su foo` switches your 
current user to foo, but it won't load foo's environment. That means you will
still have the previous users environment. Where as `su - foo` will actually
load foo's envrionment meaning it will source the new .bashrc .profile etc.
