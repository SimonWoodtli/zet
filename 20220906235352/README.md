# Linux Distros that I like or find interesting

I gotta test the nixOS package manager on Fedora/Debian. It might be a good solution to avoid third-party repositories.

* [Fedora]: My current favourite, [Download Fedora]
* [Debian]: Use SID, good mix between stable enough and not too outdated, [Download Debian SID/free], [Download Debian SID/nonfree]
* [Arch Linux]: Good for pentesting, containers, mini installs that need bleeding edge software [Download Arch]
* [Arti Linux]: Arch without systemd, [Download Arti]
* [NixOS]: I have to test it, [Download NixOS]
* [Whonix]: Good as a VM for safe enough Tor environment
* [Tails]: If even more privacy/security than with Whonix is needed. (At that point you might also want to consider running it only in a Xen hypervisor. This helps as Xen is slick and avoids bloat and potential attack surface of a KVM.)
