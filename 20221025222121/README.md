# What are Docker Containers?

## What is Docker doing?

Traditional virtualization in Virtual Machines are virtualizing the hardware. However Docker virtualizes the operating system. Meaning with Docker you have a Host OS that has Docker installed. And Docker can now install containers. 


Containers are used to create an environment that your application needs to run, be tested and deployed. But that environments can be a different OS to the Dockers Host OS. Meaning you can have an Ubuntu Host OS and a Docker container Arch Linux OS with a specific environment and all the dependencies installed that your applications needs, but only that. So Docker containers are often minimalistic environments to run a specific app and not a full blown OS with systemd and all that jazz. But you can also configure a container to be a full blown OS.

## What are Containers?

Crazy fast light-weight micro computers. But they can be as powerful as you want them to be.

They have:
* own Operating System
* own CPU
* own RAM
* own Network
* and most importantly they are totally isolated
