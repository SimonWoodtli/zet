# Zettelkasten Tags: 3 Rules to create a knowledge repository

1. if you read tech related stuff always write notes along with it and if ideas related to what you read come up write them down before you continue on reading and then forget about your idea.
2. tags that help you remember how to get back to the zettel
3. every 3 or 4 days go over your currently created notes to better organize them. This can be things like: changing tags, adding tags, merging one zettel with an older already existing zettel, creating related links to other zettels, edit the title, edit the zettel to be more succinct.

* don't tag with keywords based on the material you read
* use tags that are for you to remember what the zettel was about in the future
* if you read a page or a section in a book or online and you want to create a zettel about it. The tags you create for it should be inspired on the application of this knowledge. (like oh I bet this would be useful if i were to build this project or want to do something specific in the future and the tag would be the project/idea specific usecase )

Create tags based on the reason why you create a zettel. If you had a problem and you solved this problem and create a zettel about it tag about this topic. Like if you are reading about a book about async javascript. The real reason why you read this book is to solve a specific problem to build a platform/project. So your notes on the book would be tagged based on the reason why you read the book. (what was the specific problem you had that let you to read about it). you might know specific use cases when to write async code or for what projects async code can be used. Those are the tags you want to give your notes.
