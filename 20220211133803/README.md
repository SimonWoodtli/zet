# Learning TMUX: Resources

TMUX is a terminal multiplexer. So TMUX lets you create multiple windows or panes within your terminal. Making it very convenient to work on different places simultaneously. 

* `tmux` hotkey is by default CTRL-B
* `screen` (older systems multiplexer) hotkey is CTRL-A

Since CTRL-A is both easier to type and used with screen it makes sense to change this in `tmux`.
