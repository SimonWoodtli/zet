# NixOS cheatsheet

## build

* rebuild system: `nixos-rebuild build`
* rebuild system and switch: `nixos-rebuild switch` 

## general

* update system: `nix-channel --update && sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade`
* checkout config man: `man configuration.nix`
* checkout home manager man: `man home-configuration.nix`
* rm old unused packages: `sudo nix-collect-garbage -d`
* list all generations: `nix-env --list-generations`
* switch generation: `nix-env --switch-generation`
* search: `nix search <query>`

## nix profile

* `nix profile diff-closures` - show the closure difference between each version of a profile
* `nix profile history` - show all versions of a profile
* `nix profile install` - install a package into a profile
* `nix profile list` - list installed packages
* `nix profile remove` - remove packages from a profile
* `nix profile rollback` - roll back to the previous version or a specified version of a profile
* `nix profile upgrade` - upgrade packages using their most recent flake
* `nix profile wipe-history` - delete non-current versions of a profile

## nix-shell

> üßê A `nix-shell` will temporarily modify your \$PATH environment variable. This can be used to try a piece of software before deciding to permanently install it.

## nix-channel

> üßê If you use flakes you don't need channels.

## nix-env

I prefer setting up flakes and use `nix profile` instead of `nix-env`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è  Using `nix-env` permanently modifies a local profile of installed packages. This must be updated and maintained by the user in the same way as with a traditional package manager, foregoing many of the benefits that make Nix uniquely powerful. Using `nix-shell` or a NixOS configuration is recommended instead.

* list all programs installed with nix-env: `nix-env -q`
* install with nix-env: `nix-env -iA nixos.XX`
* uninstall with nix-env: `nix-env --uninstall XX`
