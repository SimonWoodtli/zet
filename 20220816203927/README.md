# Minimalist Web Browser

A list of projects to keep an eye on and see if they become a real alternative.

* Most promising is Nyxt with the extensibility via Lisp.
* Currently the best thing to actually use is Vieb. It also works pretty well out of the box.
* Least promising is Bad Wolf because of the lack of vim bindings.

## [Nyxt]

TODO: Install and figure out what works and doesn't

* Speed? -> Find out
* Supports Dark Mode via [init.lisp]
* YT privacy frontend? -> Find out
* Adblock by default? -> Find out
* Extension support via Lisp
* Vim Bindings, Emac Bindings
* Install: Arch: official, Debian & Fedora: binary from their website
* WebKitGTK+

## [Bad Wolf] 

TODO: Ask in IRC if Dark Mode, Ad Block and Extension support exists

* Loads webpages relative fast including YT and bloated stuff
* Currently it seems not to be able to get a DarkMode going, otherwise I like it.
* You can change the looking of the interface but not the actual CSS theme like "Dark Reader" does.
* YT privacy frontend not supported
* No Adblock by default
* Extension Support?
* Regular Browser Bindings -> No Vim Bindings
* Install: Arch: AUR, Debian: from source, Fedora: official repo
